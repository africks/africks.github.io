<h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>My name is Alex Fricks. I am a junior at Eastern Washington University majoring in history with a minor in public history. I am interested in web design because it satisfies both my creative side and analytical side in a way that not many other things do. I listen to a lot of music, but most recently I have been listening to the <i>Hamilton</i> soundtrack and Joanna Newsom's new album <i>Divers</i>.

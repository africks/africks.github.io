        <h2>Here are a few web pages I really like.</h2>
            <li>
                <a href="http://letters-inc.jp/">Letters, inc.</a>
                <p>My favorite part of this site is how much movement there is in the background while scrolling. It is very responsive to the user.</p></li>
            <li><a href="http://cafefrida.ca/#menu">Cafe frida</a>
                <p>My favorite part of this site is the way that the home screen interacts when you scroll down, and that the flowers don't completely disappear when you scroll down.</p></li>
            <li><a href="http://swaywater.com/">Sway</a>
                <p>I like the home screen in the site as well. I like how after you scroll down the "Water for the senses" line appears slowly instead of instantly. I also like the way that the navigation bar sticks to the top once you scroll past it.</p>
